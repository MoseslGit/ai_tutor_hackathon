When Zoghlin took the job, he served as the President of his religious community that conducted social welfare programs on a regular basis. In addition, he managed the investments for his large extended family. He did not get paid for his religious community activity or the family investments. Seeing the impressive returns he generated, his friends persuaded him to manage their investments, as well. Now, a year later, he has stopped serving the religious community. He manages investments for non-family members, but charges 10% of the portfolio value as his fee. Zoghlin has not informed his employer of any of these activities. With regard to which of the business activities, has Zoghlin least likely violated the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct?'"
